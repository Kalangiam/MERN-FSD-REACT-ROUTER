            <li>MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) is a popular full-stack development framework that utilizes JavaScript across the entire stack. Here's an overview of each component:

MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It's known for its scalability, flexibility, and performance, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data in modern web applications.

Express.js: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, designed to simplify the process of building web applications and APIs. It provides a robust set of features for routing, middleware support, and templating, allowing developers to create server-side applications efficiently.</li>
            <li>Node.js: Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient for handling concurrent connections and processing requests. Node.js is commonly used to create server-side logic and APIs in MEAN stack applications.</li>
          
        </ul>
