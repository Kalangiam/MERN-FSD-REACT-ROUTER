            <li>A research course in machine learning is typically designed for students or professionals who are interested in conducting original research in the field of machine learning. These courses provide a deep dive into advanced topics, methodologies, and techniques that are essential for conducting research in machine learning. Here's an outline of what you might expect from such a course:</li>
            <li>Research courses cover advanced topics beyond the scope of introductory or intermediate courses. This may include cutting-edge research areas such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), transfer learning, meta-learning, federated learning, and more.</li>
            <li>Students learn how to conduct literature reviews to understand the state-of-the-art research in specific subfields of machine learning. They analyze and critique research papers, identifying key contributions, methodologies, and limitations of existing work.</li>
