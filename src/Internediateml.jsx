        <ul>
            <li>While introductory courses often focus on supervised learning, intermediate courses introduce unsupervised learning techniques for discovering patterns and structures in data. This includes clustering algorithms like k-means, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).</li>
            <li>Intermediate courses cover techniques for working with unstructured data types such as text and images. This might include natural language processing (NLP) tasks like text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition, and document classification, as well as computer vision tasks like image preprocessing, object detection, image classification, and image segmentation.</li>
            <li>Transitioning machine learning models from development to production environments is a critical aspect of real-world applications. Intermediate courses explore best practices and tools for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining machine learning models in production, including containerization, serverless computing, model versioning, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.</li>
